# Twitter removal for Chrome

### What it is ?
This project aimed at nothing important just removing twitter from the web.
It will remove :
* Widgets
* Quotes
* Links
* Logos

It will even redirect you if you are going on a website with the word 'twitter' 
inside the URL. So you cannot even look at this repository with the extension 
activated.

### Why ?
I don't like it :)
